		title: "Diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome: a global “consensus-2”",
		description: "The concept that disease rooted principally in chronic aberrant constitutive and reactive activation of mast cells (MCs), without the gross MC neoplasia in mastocytosis, first emerged in the 1980s, but only in the last decade has recognition of “mast cell activation syndrome” (MCAS) grown significantly. Two principal proposals for diagnostic criteria have emerged. One, originally published in 2012, is labeled by its authors as a “consensus” (re-termed here as “consensus-1”). Another sizable contingent of investigators and practitioners favor a different approach (originally published in 2011, newly termed here as “consensus-2”), resembling “consensus-1” in some respects but differing in others, leading to substantial differences between these proposals in the numbers of patients qualifying for diagnosis (and thus treatment). Overdiagnosis by “consensus-2” criteria has potential to be problematic, but underdiagnosis by “consensus-1” criteria seems the far larger problem given (1) increasing appreciation that MCAS is prevalent (up to 17% of the general population), and (2) most MCAS patients, regardless of illness duration prior to diagnosis, can eventually identify treatment yielding sustained improvement. We analyze these proposals (and others) and suggest that, until careful research provides more definitive answers, diagnosis by either proposal is valid, reasonable, and helpful.",

		title: "Mast Cell Disease: Overview and Diagnosis",
		description: "MCD, MCAD, MCAS… there are so many acronyms in the mast cell disease community, and they can be confusing. Let’s clarify so we can all understand each other. Mast cell disease(s) (MCD) is the term used by mast cell specialists in the U.S. and internationally for all mast cell diseases. This covers each variant: systemic mastocytosis (SM), cutaneous mastocytosis (CM), smoldering mastocytosis (SSM), advanced disease variants, mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HaT). Since MCD covers all variants of mast cell disease, it is inclusive of every patient suffering from any type of mast cell disease. The American Initiative in Mast Cell Diseases (AIM) also chose their name to represent all mast cell diseases. MCAD is an older term used by some that meant mast cell activation disorder. Some physicians and patients still use the term disorder as we all slowly transition to disease. MCAS is a specific syndrome with diagnostic criteria to define it and is not interchangeable with MCAD. We can all work and learn together.",
